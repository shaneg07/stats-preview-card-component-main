 My First Front-End Mentor Challenge

I followed a tutorial on Youtube to get an idea on how CSS works.
When I was following the tutorial I kept trying to predict what is going to be the next step,
and in the end my code is slightly better, and I ended up learning lots of new things.
It took my two days to complete this.
